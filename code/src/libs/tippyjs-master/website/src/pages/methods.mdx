### Instance methods

Methods on instances allow you to control the tippy programmatically. See the
[Tippy Instance](/tippy-instance/) page for details on accessing an instance.

#### show

Programmatically show the tippy at any time:

```js
instance.show() // Default
instance.show(0) // 0ms transition duration
```

#### hide

Programmatically hide the tippy at any time:

```js
instance.hide() // Default
instance.hide(500) // 500ms transition duration
```

#### disable

Temporarily prevent a tippy from showing or hiding:

```js
instance.disable()
```

#### enable

Re-enable a tippy:

```js
instance.enable()
```

#### set

You can update any option after the instance has been created. Pass an object of
new options in:

```js
instance.set({
  arrow: true,
  animation: 'scale',
})
```

#### setContent

Updating the `content` option has its own method as a shortcut:

```js
instance.setContent('New content')
```

#### destroy

To permanently destroy and clean up the instance, use this method:

```js
instance.destroy()
```

The `_tippy` property is deleted from the reference element upon destruction.

If you're destroying a delegate instance (i.e., one you created with the
`target` option), pass `true` as an argument to destroy all child instances that
may have been created too.

```js
instance.destroy(true)
```

### Static methods

Static methods belong to the `tippy` module function rather than a tippy
instance.

#### setDefaults

Set the default options for each new instance:

```js
tippy.setDefaults({
  // Options
})

// Access the current defaults
tippy.defaults
```

#### hideAll

Hide all visible tippys on the document:

```js
// Use each tippy's own duration
tippy.hideAll()
// Hide them all instantly
tippy.hideAll({ duration: 0 })
// Hide them all except a particular one
tippy.hideAll({ exclude: tippyInstance })
tippy.hideAll({ exclude: referenceElement })
```

#### group

Used to improve UX for elements near each other when their tooltips have a
`delay`. Learn about [`tippy.group()` here](/misc#groups).
